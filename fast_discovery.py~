"""
Provides the discovery API for stable topologies on OpenFlow-only networks

This module piggybacks on the normal discovery module, and you can pass any
of the normal discovery commandline options to it.  Links are initially
discovered by the normal discovery, and we monitor link state via PortStatus.
